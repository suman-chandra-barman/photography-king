          1.Difference between SQL and NoSQL?

          <p>
            SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are
            horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL
            databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL
            databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is
            better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

            What is JWT (JSON Web Token)? JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open
            standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between
            parties as JSON object. It is compact, readable and digitally signed
            using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity
            Provider(IdP).

        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with
            any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node. js, on
            the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the
            JavaScript programming language.

          4. How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            How NodeJS handle multiple client requests? NodeJS receives multiple
            client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built
            with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own
            EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and
            processes them.
